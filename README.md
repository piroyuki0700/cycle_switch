<p>
The controller program for raspberry pi GPIO and its setting html page.
This program is made with the AI program generator (deepseek) and it is for my own use so far.
I am planning to connect one air pump and two water pumps to my raspberry pi zero 2w.
It is a part of my simple hydroponics system.

Before starting it on raspberry pi device, it is needed to modify app.py to use RPi.GPIO module instead of mock_gpio.
And then replace the server name in api urls to an appropriate server name in template/index.html.
