# cycle_switch
The controller program for raspberry pi GPIO and its setting html page.
This program is made with the AI program generator (deepseek) and it is for my own use so far.
I am planning to connect one air pump and two water pumps to my raspberry pi zero 2w.
It is a part of my simple hydroponics system.
